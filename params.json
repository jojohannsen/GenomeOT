{"name":"GenomeOT","tagline":"Genomes Over Time","body":"### Genomes Over Time\r\nAt some level, genomes are incredibly stable over time.  For example, chromosome 8 has a layout that has not changed in millions of years.\r\n\r\nThe scripts here are a way to visualize relationships between species by comparing chromosomes.  The input to the script is any number of FASTA chromosome files from public sites, and a configuration file listing which chromosomes to compare.  The output is a set of images for each comparison.\r\n\r\n### Example Configuration files\r\nConfigurations files are provided for comparing Human, Chimp, Gorilla, Pongo Abelii, and Macaca Fascicularis, along with test scripts for using those configurations.\r\n\r\n### Result Resolution\r\nThe images below are using 100,000 base pairs per pixel, and the smaller version uses 1 million base pairs per pixel.  Species A is represented along the horizontal axis, Species B is represented along the vertical axis.  The processing loads Species B into a suffix tree, then scans Species A in k-mer size sections (images below used 20), and a threshold for matches.  Forward matches above threshold give green pixel, reverse-complement matches above threshold give a red pixel (these show the large inversions).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
